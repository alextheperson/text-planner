Movement - to move, use the two sets of 4 keys on either side of the home row. On a QWERTY keyboard, thats a, s, d & f and h, j, k & l. The left 4 move your view, while the right 4 move your cursor.

Modes - There are 4 modes that you can use to do different things. Right now, you are in VIEW MODE, which lets you move around and press buttons. If you press "m", you will go into MOVE MODE, which lets you move objects or parts of objects. When in MOVE MODE, the keys you use to move the view will move you cursor, and the keys you use to move your cursor will move the object that cursor is on top of. You can press "w" to go into EDIT MODE, which lets you edit properties of objects, like the content of a textbox or whether a line has arrows. If you press ":" you be able to type commands that let you do more complicated things like creating elements or binding properties. In any mode, if you press "enter" or "escape", you will go back to VIEW MODE

Commands - Most of the stuff you can do is done through commands. Commands use a very LISP-like syntax. Commands separate their parameters with spaces. If a parameter needs to contain a space, you can wrap it in double quotes if it is a string, or parentheses if it is a command. To call a command, prefix it with a colon (e.g. ":new text"). You can also create a callback that can be run later by omitting the colon.

Bindings - Many objects have properties that can be bound to commands. You can bind properties with the ":bind" command, which uses the syntax ":bind object property_name command". When bound, the property with update itself to match the output of the command. Using the ":get" command, you can base one objects properties off of another.
